## Advantages

Palladio is a software architecture simulation approach which analyses your software at the model level for performance bottlenecks, scalability issues, reliability threats, and allows for a subsequent optimisation. Palladio requires neither buying expensive executions environments (servers, networks, or storage) nor fully implementing a software product. Construction rules are automatically checked by Palladio and thus allow optimal software architectures without costly trial-and-error-cycles. Like in other engineering disciplines, Palladio enables software engineers to construct software straight and in the right way.

Decide for Palladio today to
- Forecast the impact of your design decisions
- Lower the costs for trial-and-error-cycles
- Build highly reliable, scalable, and resource-efficient software architectures

## Palladio: The software architecture simulator

- Palladio is free tooling, professional consulting, and a well-validated scientific performance and reliability prediction approach.
- Analyse multiple quality dimensions: Performance, reliability, maintainability, and costs. Balance your software architecture design.
- Engineering instead of trial and error. No implementation required. No hardware required. Model-driven. Interactive analysis.
